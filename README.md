Repo for course project.

This repo is for course project (Coursera: Getting and Cleaning data)
I've write R code to make a tidy data set which contains averages of many activities from 30 people.
  Original data from

About anlaysis_run.R

To work the code, please sure few things.
  1. download data from the link above
  2. Set the "right" location where the data is in.
     (In my code, setwd() is in the first line.)
  3. When you run the code, you will find the txt file, "coureProject.txt" , as the result of it.
  4. Please find the file where you set at the seconde step.

How R code works

I tried my best to follow the guide from the team. 
So I gurantee that you will never lose your way as you read the code.
Here are steps.
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each          activity and each subject.
