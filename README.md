# Getting-and-Cleaning-data
Repo for course project.

This repo is for course project (Coursera: Getting and Cleaning data)
I've write R code to make a tidy data set which contains averages of many activities from 30 people.
  Original data from 
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

To work the code, please sure few things.
  1. download data from the link above
  2. Set the "right" location where the data is in.
     (In my code, setwd() is in the first line.)
  3. When you run the code, you will find the txt file, "coureProject.txt" , as the result of it.
  4. Please find the file where you set at the seconde step.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
